                <p>I was born in Cincinnati, Ohio and after a few moves in my early years my family I landed in Olathe, KS. I was in first grade at the time and we have been in the Kansas City area ever since.</p>
                <p>I attended high school at Olathe South and graduated in 2005. I began my college career at Johnson County Community College. I went to school there for two years while working full time. After my time at JCCC was up it was off to Kansas State where I graduated in December 2009 with a degree in Business Administration with an emphasis in Human Resources.</p>
                <p>I moved back to Olathe after graduation and have worked for AMC Theatres, Farmers Insurance, and my current job which I have now worked at for over 7 years, <a id="work-link" href="https://kansascity.swagelok.com" target="_blank">Swagelok Kansas City.</a></p>
                <p>My wife Kristen and I were married on September 14th 2013 (we were highschool sweethearts). Our first child Hunter was born on September 24th, 2016 and baby Katzer #2 is due on November 29th of this year! I also have a dog named Dexter and he is a Pug/Beagle mix.</p>
                <p>When Iâ€™m not working, in class, or working on homework I can be found: Spending time with my family (more than likely at the park), hanging out in the mancave either playing video games or watching tv, doing yard work, or doing chores around the house. This list also happens to be in order of likeliness!</p>
